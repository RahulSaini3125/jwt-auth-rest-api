URL configuration for the accounts app.

This module defines the URL patterns for the accounts app. It imports the necessary views
and maps URLs to these views. Currently, the urlpatterns list is empty and should be updated
with paths to views as they are implemented.

Examples:
    from . import views
    urlpatterns = [
        path('login/', views.LoginView.as_view(), name='login'),
        path('logout/', views.LogoutView.as_view(), name='logout'),
        path('register/', views.RegisterView.as_view(), name='register'),
    ]

Attributes:
    urlpatterns (list): A list of URL patterns to be used by the Django URL dispatcher.
